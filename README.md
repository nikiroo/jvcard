# jVCard
Small TUI (text mode) VCard manager (also supports abook files)

## Current version

- it can open VCF and ABOOK files
- it can create a Swing terminal or use a real terminal (try "--help") using Lanterna 3 (which can be found here on GitHub, too)
- it will list all the contacts of the file you select
- it will show more detailed informations about a selected contact, including an ASCII art representation of their photo if any
- it can create/delete a contact
- it can be used to edit your data (currently in RAW format, field by field)
- it can save back to file
- English and French versions available (will look for the host language, can be forced with "--lang en")
- remote synchronisation server (still in testing, but should work)

## TODO

- lot of other things
- correct UI for new contact/new data/edit data-types
- update the screenshots
